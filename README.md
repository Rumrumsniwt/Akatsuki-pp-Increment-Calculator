# Akatsuki-pp-Increment-Calculator-ver1.0
A calculator to return how much pp from a single map you need to obtain to gain certain amount of pp

# Current problem:
* You need at least 99 local scores on your userpage
* It assumes that the total amount of pp after your 100th score doesn't change, which is inaccurate if you don't have enough scores like me :)
* Total pp needs manually input
